              "content": "Systolic dysfunction refers to a failure of contraction, leading to decreased ejection fraction and dilated ventricles. The ventricular walls may appear thin and overstretched, leading to balloon-like chambers with reduced contractility.\n\nDiastolic dysfunction, on the other hand, is primarily a filling problem. The ventricle becomes hypertrophied and stiff, reducing its ability to relax and fill properly during diastole. Ejection fraction remains normal because the ventricle can still contract, but less blood enters it in the first place.\n\nLeft-sided failure causes blood to back up into the pulmonary veins and capillaries, leading to pulmonary edema and symptoms such as dyspnea, orthopnea, and crackles on auscultation.\n\nRight-sided failure leads to systemic venous congestion, producing signs such as peripheral edema, distended neck veins, hepatomegaly, ascites, and even generalized anasarca.\n\nCompensatory mechanisms include increased sympathetic activity and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). These mechanisms initially help maintain blood pressure and perfusion but eventually worsen the condition by causing sodium and water retention, vasoconstriction, and ventricular remodeling."

Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is elevated in heart failure and serves as a diagnostic marker.\n3. ACE inhibitors are the cornerstone of long-term management because they prevent or reverse ventricular remodeling.\n4. Digoxin toxicity is often precipitated by hypokalemia, so potassium levels must be monitored.\n5. Carvedilol, metoprolol, and bisoprolol are the beta-blockers proven to improve survival in chronic heart failure.\n6. ARNI combinations such as sacubitril and valsartan reduce hospitalization and mortality compared to ACE inhibitors alone.\n7. Diuretics provide symptomatic relief but do not reduce mortality.\n8. Calcium channel blockers like verapamil and diltiazem should be avoided in systolic heart failure because they are negative inotropes.\n9. SGLT2 inhibitors now play a key role in improving outcomes in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.\n\n--- Pharmacology Detail ---\n\n• Diuretics (Furosemide): Reduce fluid overload. Symptomatic relief only. No survival benefit.\n• ACE Inhibitors (Lisinopril): Decrease preload/afterload. Prevent remodeling. Side effect: Cough.\n• ARBs (Losartan): Use if ACEi not tolerated.\n• ARNIs (Sacubitril/Valsartan): Vasodilation + Natriuresis. Superior to ACEi.\n• Beta-blockers (Bisoprolol/Carvedilol): Counteract sympathetic toxicity. Essential for chronic management.\n• Aldosterone Antagonists (Spironolactone): Prevent fibrosis/remodeling. Watch for Gynecomastia.\n• Digoxin: Inhibits Na/K ATPase. Increases contractility. Toxicity signs: Nausea, Yellow vision. Antidote: Digi-bind.\n• Ivabradine: Blocks If current in SA node. Reduces HR.\n• SGLT2 Inhibitors (Dapagliflozin): Reduce hospitalization and mortality.",
